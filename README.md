# Console LED Trigger

This project controls RGB LED strips for retro gaming consoles using current sensing and an encoder-based UI. The LED module turns on when a console powers up and allows for user-configurable color and brightness using a rotary encoder with a button.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® **Automatic Power Detection**: Turns LEDs on/off based on console current draw.
- ðŸŒˆ **Color Selection**: Rotate encoder to cycle through predefined colors.
- ðŸ’¡ **Brightness Adjustment**: Long-press (2s) to enter brightness mode, rotate to adjust.
- ðŸ’¾ **Persistent Settings**: Saves selected color and brightness between power cycles.
- ðŸŒ™ **Soft Off Delay**: Waits 5 seconds after power off before fading out.
- âœ¨ **Smooth Fading**: Fades between colors and off-state with a polished transition.
- ðŸ“¶ **WiFi Support**: Configurable via captive portal for OTA and future expansion. (optional)
- ðŸ§­ **Dashboard Control**: View all connected modules, their status, and update settings  from a web UI. (requires WiFi)
- ðŸ”„ **OTA Updates**: Update firmware wirelessly using ArduinoOTA. (requires WiFi)

## Configuration

Adjust thresholds and pin assignments in `config.h` and `pins.h`.  
Predefined colors are listed in `colors.h`.

|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `NUM_PIXELS`              | Number of WS2812 LEDs connected.                          |
| `CURRENT_THRESHOLD`       | Baseline ADC threshold to detect console power.           |
| `CURRENT_SENSE_OFFSET`    | Hysteresis value to prevent flickering near threshold.    |
| `CURRENT_THRESHOLD_ON`    | Calculated threshold to detect "power on".                |
| `CURRENT_THRESHOLD_OFF`   | Calculated threshold to detect "power off".               |
| `ENCODER_STEPS_PER_CLICK` | Encoder resolution adjustment.                            |
| `LONG_PRESS_THRESHOLD`    | Time required to trigger brightness mode with long press. |
| `POWER_OFF_DELAY`         | Time to wait before fading LEDs off after current drops.  |

## Wi-Fi Enable Jumper
Wi-Fi and OTA functionality is **only initialized if a jumper is placed** across the first two pins (left to right) of the 3-pin header at boot.

## Connectivity

### WiFi Setup

- On first boot or if no WiFi is saved, the ESP32 starts an **Access Point** named `Console-LED-AP`.
- Connect to that network from your phone/laptop.
- A captive portal will appear. Enter your WiFi credentials.
- The ESP32 will save the SSID and password for future use.

If connection fails, the device reboots and retries WiFi/AP setup.

### Web Dashboard

If Wi-Fi is enabled, modules will appear in the web dashboard.

#### From the dashboard, you can:
- View all online/offline devices
- See current color, brightness, and power state
- Update color and brightness
- Change device display name

The dashboard runs separately under `/dashboard`, built with TypeScript, TanStack, and Mantine.

### OTA Updates

Once connected to WiFi:

- The device starts the **Arduino OTA service**.
- You can use the Arduino IDE or `arduino-cli` to push firmware updates over the network.
